      "message": "the application should put its own ID in the allocateResource RPC, so that the resource manager can assign the resource based on some pre-set validations for the requestor. we could try and keep table ID space in increasing order, in case some application does a hand-off directly to a lower priority application, for example (but this is not a hard requirement). similarly, we could add an upper bound in future on how many of each type of resource an application can consume",
