      "message": "technically you\u0027ve slightly changed the behaviour, because before *ALL* system properties had to be set, and if e.g. only 2 were set and 1 not then all would be defaulted.. but I doubt that ever was intentional, so your change here, although not strictly speaking 100% backward compatible, makes sense to me and does seem more consistent.  Just to be extra careful, I\u0027ll +1 instead of +2 it just so that others can have a look as well.",
