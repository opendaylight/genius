In a test, I would just let this \"bubble up\" via throws TransactionCommitFailedException ... or, if you have a big problem with having to add that \"throws\" everywhere (personally I think it\u0027s OK and the Right Thing to do), then you would have to rethrow it as some runtime exception, such as perhaps an IllegalStateException or even a AssertionError (but again, I would just not catch it at all and let it propagate by declaring \"throws TransactionCommitFailedException\")",
