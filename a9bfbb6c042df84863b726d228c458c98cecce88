      "message": "No, I\u0027ve had a closer look locally myself now, and it\u0027s because lockmanager-impl depends on the (old) mdsalutils-testutils which in turn depends on the (new) genius.tools-testutils, all with \u003cscope\u003etest, so it\u0027s all good and correct as-is!  (My fear was just that we somewhere pull in a testutils without a scope test, which would have been bad because it would pollute the runtime, but we are not; so it\u0027s all good; please ignore.)",
