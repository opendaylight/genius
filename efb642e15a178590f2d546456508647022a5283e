      "message": "The proposal restricts that the consumer application of this monitoring service always has to program a group on the DPNs, where a group bucket watches this watch-port. That is, watch port is the only way the consumer is intimated of tunnel status. An additional event in the controller originated by ITM about tunnel status can help those consumers who do not intend to program a group.",

      "message": "This explanation may not be entirely correct. Even BFD monitoring with point to point tunnel may not scale if all O(n**2). Hence this whole proposal is about need based monitoring to reduce the monitored set of tunnels to reduce it to a small subset of O(n**2) tunnels. LLDP \u0026 ARP might scale enough for the subset.",
