      "message": "exactly, this is a pure clean-up type change which should not have any impact, as per the Commit Message, copy/paste:\n\nThis is JUST a clean-up, to make this class more easy to understand. This should (AFAIK) NOT change anything in its behaviour, so safe.\n\nThis is also to align it with e.g. https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/63505/ (and perhaps more changed like that to come) - seeing the exact same ExecutorService used in both IMHO makes it clearer how similar this old and that new async DTCL are.",
