      "message": "Is this something you\u0027ve actually run into, or just think it may happen? I wouldn\u0027t code anything like that just in case, but only if tests show a bug.  Also, and more importantly, the problem you mention should be handled inside the IdManager component or the createIdPool() method, not here, agreed? And createIdPool() does already \"handle\" it, I think; there won\u0027t be an exception, just a LOG.error(\"Failed to create idPool for InterfaceMgr\").  So I would just remove the try/catch/throw and simply let it propagate; that\u0027s what\u0027 it\u0027s currently as is proposed heere doing anyway, just weird/ugly/confusing catch and identical rethrow.",
