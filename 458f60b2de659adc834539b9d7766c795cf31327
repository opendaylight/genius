      "message": "I don\u0027t really understand this (and the getExpectedJobCount() and its usage below).  Wouldn\u0027t everything work just the same way here if you just completely removed this?  If the idea is to be able to do something like \"cumulative\" JobCoordinatorEventsWaiter.awaitJobsConsumption(n), then would that not better be a new functionality offered in TestableJobCoordinatorEventsWaiter itself (with a test of it in TestableJobCoordinatorEventsWaiterTest...), instead of bolting that on to this InterfaceManagerConfigurationTest here?",

      "message": "The clearedTask meter given by JC will be a cumulative count of all the jobs enqueued so far. interface-manager uses JC heavily, and if you check there are jobs being enqueued even for our beforeTest and afterTest methods. For each functional piece of code, I felt it is not right to pass the cumulative count hardcoded, and felt it will be good to somehow track the \"jobCount so far\", and the \"new job count to be introduced by the new functional part of TC\" . Do you think it makes sense to move this to JCEventsWaiter, as it will have to maintain something like \"clearedTaskCountPrev\" and then add it to the incoming count?",
