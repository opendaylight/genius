      "message": "as discussed yesterday, this won\u0027t really work, because it could report Operational even if there was an Exception from another @Singleton within this BP bundle.  I believe the approach proposed in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/63509/ will be better, which in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/63509/4/diagstatus/impl/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/infrautils/diagstatus/internal/DiagStatusServiceImpl.java onSystemBootReady() sets all services to Operational... do you want to get that in, and then remove this here?  As discussed, that\u0027s only a first version, as it\u0027s \"global\" - future work will hopefully make that more granular, per bundle.  (And if you think that is absolutely needed first, then please let me know.)",
