      "message": "Could you detail the status of ingress service binding for tunnels? it seems like the code is already there but it\u0027s simply not used\nIf this is the case, would it make sense to create a default ingress service for tunnel interfaces to simply direct the ingress traffic from the tunnel to the ingress tunnel table (36)? it would not make much of a difference for current applications but would allow binding additional higher-priority services such as tap on tunnel interfaces",

      "message": "Tali, ingress service binding support is already there. Though we are trying to enhance the pipeline by making everything dispatch from Table 17. With the current code, if you bind a service on tunnel with goto table 36, it will work...but if there are multiple services bound on the same tunnel, you should make sure that the application table miss should be to Table 17..",
