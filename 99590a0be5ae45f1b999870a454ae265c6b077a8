      "message": "FYI the statsEnabled(true) will theoretically have a very small performance overhead, according to Guice documentation.  But I suspect that in the overall scheme of things of everything we are doing in ODL it is absolutely irrelevant though, so I don\u0027t mind and will +1 not -1 because of this anyway.  Just so you know though, and as an FYI may be for future perhaps more performance critical code paths, my original idea wasn\u0027t that  one would enable stats via this in the code when setting up the Cache, but that one would do this via the CLI (via \"cache:policy ovsVersionCache statsEnabled true\") e.g. in lab tests, when needed.",

However I prefer syncReadOptional b/c throwing an exception is expensive and should really be for uncommon/unexpected failures. \n\nSo what should happen if the read actually fails? That means you don\u0027t know if the node exists and has a version so it seems returning and caching DEFAULT_OVS_VERSION doesn\u0027t seem right. I\u0027d think you\u0027d want to propagate the error to the caller. hat\u0027s the way DataObjectCache handles it (another plug for DataObjectCache :)).",
