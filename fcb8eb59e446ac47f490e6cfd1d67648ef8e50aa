      "message": "NOK: I\u0027ve no idea what this code really does, but it seems to me that the transformation you\u0027re doing here is not a 1:1 equivalent?  Because in the original the incrementAndGet() would not have happend in the else, IfAbsent, right? So doesn\u0027t this lead to it being off +1? Doesn\u0027t matter? (If this is intentional and I\u0027m missing, then a comment here for reviewers would help to clarify...)",
