You can probably remove the entire dependency, not just the version.  If not, then please let me know so that we can have a closer look why you needed this here.",

BTW, in this context, have a look at the org.opendaylight.infrautils.testutils.RunUntilFailureRule which is useful to convince yourself (locally, never commit), that your test is not flaky, but leaving it running for 1h while you go have lunch...",
