      "message": "you need to pass whatever information you need into here as part of a key.  I suspect your \"key\" is going to have to be more than a simple String?  Just create a simple new composite value holder class, and use that as your key:\n\n   class Something { \n      private final String thisThing; \n      private final String thatThing; \n\n      Something(String thisThing, String thatThat) {\n          this.thingThing \u003d thisThing;\n          that.thingThing \u003d thatThing;\n      }\n\n      String thatThing() { return thatThing; }\n\nIf you find you have to write a lot of these, then you can start looking at using http://immutables.github.io for it (later!).",
