I don\u0027t remember which exception it was. In that case alone, we should catch , and other cases it still holds good to report ERROR. Otherwise this patch will cause issues in 3 node CSIT",

So I\u0027ll just catch for IdPool exceptions and not report error since with idpool creation any one node succeeding is good enough. I have some ideas on how to do all this in a better way, will discuss in next meeting or IRC.",
