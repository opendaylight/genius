      "message": "The changes in this class appear to be extensive refactorings, some code disappeared.. this seems goes quite a bit beyond \"just\" CSS to BP migration.  It would probably be good if someone else with a better understanding of this code could make sure it\u0027s OK to remove some of the methods that are removed here, and could functionally test non-regression of this change..",

      "message": "Yes, I had to migrate the code that was present in the provider class to the MDSALManager, so I was forced to make some refactoring. I think the class would deserve even more refactoring, since having so many lines and methods makes difficult to follow. That\u0027s why I stopped and leave some other changes for a later patch.",
