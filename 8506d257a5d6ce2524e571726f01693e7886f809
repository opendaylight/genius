      "message": "The changes in this class appear to be extensive refactorings, some code disappeared.. this seems goes quite a bit beyond \"just\" CSS to BP migration.  It would probably be good if someone else with a better understanding of this code could make sure it\u0027s OK to remove some of the methods that are removed here, and could functionally test non-regression of this change..",
