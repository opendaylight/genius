==================================
OF-Tunnels with ITM Direct Tunnels
==================================

This document serves as the test plan for the OF Based tunnels.This document comprises of test cases pertaining to all the use case covered by the Functional Spec.

.. note::

  Name of suite and test cases should map exactly to as they appear in Robot reports.

Test Setup
==========

Brief description of test setup.

Testbed Topologies
------------------
Topology device software and inter node communication details -

#. **ODL Node** â€“ 1 or 3 Node ODL Environment should be used
#. **Switch Node** - 3 Nodes with OVS 2.6 or above

Test Topology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: topologies/default-topology.txt


Hardware Requirements
---------------------

#. 1 controller with 3 OVS for functional testing
#. 3 controller with 3 OVS for functional testing

Software Requirements
---------------------

N.A.

Test Suite Requirements
=======================

Test Suite Bringup
------------------

* itm-direct-tunnel flag should be true.

In test suit bringup build the topology as described in the Test Topology. Bring all the tunnels UP.

Test Suite Cleanup
------------------

Final steps after all tests in suite are done. This should include any cleanup, sanity checks,
configuration etc. that needs to be done once all test cases in suite are done.

Debugging
---------

Capture any debugging information that is captured at start of suite and end of suite.
