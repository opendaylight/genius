==========================
Service Recovery Framework
==========================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:service-recovery

Service Recovery Framework is a feature that enables recovery of services. This recovery
can be trigerred by user, or eventually, be used as a self-healing mechanism.


Problem description
===================

Status and Diagnostic adds support for reporting current status of different services.
However, there is no means to recover individual service or service instances that have
failed. Only recovery that can be done today is to restart the controller node(s) or
manually restart the bundle or reinstall the karaf feature itself.

Restarting the controller can be overkill and needlessly disruptive. Manually restarting bundle or
feature requires user to be aware of and have access to these CLIs. There may not be one-to-one
mapping from a service to corresponding bundle or feature. Also, a truly secure system
would provide role based access to users. Only someone with administrative rights will have
access to Karaf CLI to restart/reinstall while a less privileged user should be able to trigger
recovery without requiring higher level access.

Note that role based access is out of scope of this document


Use Cases
---------

This feature will support following use cases:

* Use Case 1: Provide RPC and CLI to trigger reinstall of a service.
* Use Case 2: Provide RPC and CLI to trigger recover a service.
* Use Case 3: Provide RPC and CLI to trigger recovery of specific instance object managed by able
  service, referred to as service instance.

Proposed change
===============

A new module Service Recovery Manager (SRM) will be added to Genius. SRM will provide single and
common point of interaction with all individual services. Recovery options will vary from highest
level service restart to restarting individual service instances.

SRM Terminology
---------------

SRM will introduce concept of service entities and operations.

SRM Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* EntityName - Every object in SRM is referred to as an entity and EntityName is the
  unique identifier for a given entity. e.g. ``L3VPN``, ``ITM``, ``VPNInstance`` etc.
* EntityType - Every entity has a corresponding type. Currently supported types are
  ``service`` and ``instance``. e.g. ``L3VPN`` is a entity of type ``service`` and ``VPNInstance``
  is an entity of type ``instance``
* EntityId - Every entity of type ``instance`` will have a unique ``entity-id`` as an
  identifier. e.g. The ``uuid`` of ``VPNInstance`` is the ``entity-id`` identifying an
  individual VPN Instance from amongst many present in ``L3VPN`` service.

SRM Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* reinstall - This command will be used to reinstall a service. This will be similar to
  ``karaf`` bundle restart, but may result in restart of more than one bundle as per the
  service. This operation will only be applicable to entity-type ``service``.
* recover - This command will be used to recover an individual entity, which can be ``service``
  or ``instance``. For ``entity-type: service`` the ``entity-name`` will be service name.
  For ``entity-type: instance`` the ``entity-name`` will be instance name and `entity-id`` will
  be a required field.

Example
^^^^^^^

This table gives some examples of different entities and operations for them:

+-----------+------------+------------------+----------------+---------------------------+
| OPERATION | EntityType |    EntityName    |   EntityId     |         Remarks           |
+===========+============+==================+================+===========================+
| reinstall | service    | ITM              | N.A.           | Restart ITM               |
+-----------+------------+------------------+----------------+---------------------------+
| recover   | service    | ITM              | ITM            | Recover ITM Service       |
+-----------+------------+------------------+----------------+---------------------------+
| recover   | instance   | TEP              | dpn-1          | Recover TEP               |
+-----------+------------+------------------+----------------+---------------------------+
| recover   | isntance   | TransportZone    | TZA            | Recover Transport Zone    |
+-----------+------------+------------------+----------------+---------------------------+

Out of Scope
------------

* SRM will not be implementing actual recovery mechanisms, it will only act as intermediary between user and
  individual services.
* SRM will not provide status of services. Status and Diagnostic (SnD) framework is expected to provide
  service status.

Pipeline changes
----------------
N.A.

Yang changes
------------
We'll be adding three new yang files

ServiceRecovery Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file will contain different types used by service recovery framework. Any service that wants
to use ServiceRecovery will have to define its supported names and types in this file.

exposed by them in `servicesrecovery-types.yang`. These are not user facing operations but

Configuration impact
---------------------
N.A.

Clustering considerations
-------------------------
SRM will provide RPCs, which will only be handled on one of the nodes. In turn, it will
write to ``servicerecovery-ops.yang`` and each individual service will have Clustered
Listeners to track operations being triggered. Individual services will decide, based
on service and instance on which recovery is triggered, if it needs to run on all nodes
on cluster or individual nodes.

Other Infra considerations
--------------------------
Status and Diagnostics (SnD) may need to be updated to user service names similar to ones
used in SRM.

Security considerations
-----------------------
Providing RPCs to trigger service restarts will eliminate the need to give administrative
access to non-admin users just so they can trigger recovery though bundle restarts from
karaf CLI. Expectation is access to these RPCs will be role based, but role based access
and its implementation is out of scope of this feature.

Scale and Performance Impact
----------------------------
This feature allows recovery at a much fine grained level than full controller or node
restart. Such restarts impact and trigger recovery of services that didn't need to be
recover. Every restart of controller cluster or individual nodes has a significant overhead
that impacts scale and performance. This feature aims to eliminate these overheads by
allowing targeted recovery.

Targeted Release
-----------------

Nitrogen.

Alternatives
------------

Using existing karaf CLI for feature and bundle restart was considered but rejected
due to reasons already captured in earlier sections.
