      "message": "IMHO it\u0027s \"nice\" (just \"sugar\") that one can call this with a GroupEntity directly, instead of having to get the dpnId and groupId out of it; so while I think it\u0027s useful that you expose a removeGroup(BigInteger dpnId, long groupId), I would also leave removeGroup(GroupEntity groupEntity).  However I do not feel strongly about this, if you think that makes this API hard to understand instead of simpler to use, then just say so and I\u0027ll remove my objection.",

      "message": "I feel more strongly against @deprecating this one.  IMHO it\u0027s GOOD that this API gives you a way to do a number of things together in one Tx (by passing one), instead of internally creating single txs; this should be encouraged, not discouraged.  It\u0027s also good to have a syntactic sugar that does not require it (I\u0027m fine with that), but I would not @Deprecate this (especially because other methods of this API have the WriteTransaction argument).",
