      "message": "As it turns out, fixing this bug actually causes unit tests to fail b/c of the static nature, ie the registrations aren\u0027t cleaned up and thus leak over to subsequent tests. The registrations should be unregistered on close however this functionality shouldn\u0027t be static either. I plan to refactor/rewrite this class properly to be non-static so I just commented out this code since it doesn\u0027t work anyway and will be going away.",
