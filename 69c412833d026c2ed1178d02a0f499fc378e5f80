      "message": "Another use case, which may also have additional requirements is to have the ability to prefer one tunnel over another for specific kinds of traffic (e.g. for a SD-WAN solution). In such case, \"important\" traffic would be sent over the \"preferred\" tunnel only while the rest could be sent over the other tunnel(s) or load balanced.",

      "message": "As far as I understand, transport zones are per DPN (not per TEP). As a result, if a DPN has multiple TEPs, my understanding of the proposal is that all TEPs would be connected to all TEPs of other DPNs. So, for example, if two DPNs each have two TEPs it would result in *four* tunnels between the two.\nIn some cases, when a DPN has multiple links for overlay, they may belong to a specific underlay network that doesn\u0027t have connectivity to all other underlays (e.g. MPLS and Internet).\nWhile this would imply that some of the tunnels would just remain down, it could be cleaner if those tunnels would never be created e.g. by having the ability to associate a TEP to a transport zone instead of the entire DPN.\nSimilarly to the current concept of TZ, a TEP could then belong to one or more TZs to allow cases where certain DPNs have multiple TEPs while others don\u0027t.",
