      "message": "Kency, to be very honest, I\u0027ve actually absolutely no idea, and don\u0027t even know what the EntityOwnershipService really is!  \n\nCould I suggest that we continue that discussion in https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d8224 instead of in this Gerrit here?  (BTW the \"as proposed in Bug 8975\" above was wrong; I\u0027ll fix it.)\n\nIf you\u0027re otherwise OK with this change as is, perhaps you could +1 it so that we can move forward with this one?",
