Perhaps log to DEBUG? Or don\u0027t throw IllegalArgumentException exception above and log to debug. I like that the best - it\u0027s usually not best practice to use exceptions for expected behavior (performance-wise).",

More is coming e.g. in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/64450/ and hopefully more after.  \n\nThe point you\u0027re making about not just suppressing ALL error logging is absolutely fair;  let me push an amendment which takes care of this specific case, so that we can get this in ASAP.\n\nBut when using this new FutureRpcResults util, we cannot just not throw IllegalArgumentException - and that was an intentional design choice I made; I\u0027ll start an email thread to properly discuss this further.  I would suggest we get this in ASAP anyway.",
