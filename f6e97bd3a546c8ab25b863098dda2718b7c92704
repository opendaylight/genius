      "message": "How about making these two lines (the arp.cache.timeout and 120000) private? it really should not be exposed, as any users should use only ARP_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, right?  \n\nActually if it\u0027s an interface (above), then you can\u0027t... so how about just removing it and inline, that seems fine to me:\n\n   long ARP_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS \u003d Long.getLong(\"arp.cache.timeout\",\n         120000; /* 120 seconds \u003d 2 minutes */);",

      "message": "this isn\u0027t needed / doesn\u0027t really make sense, as the ARP_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS is a public constant already, it\u0027s duplicated and could be confusing to use (which one am I supposed to use?) ... Your idea here, based on our chat on IRC yesterday, is probably that the implementation of this could later be changed - but that won\u0027t work anyway, it\u0027s static, with no DataBroker.. so I would just remove this method, and leave the constant - and then later refactor it better.",
