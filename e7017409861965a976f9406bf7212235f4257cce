      "message": "and IMHO property in Maven only makes sense if you use a version more than once anymore.  In this case, the daexim version is used only here, very locally, and won\u0027t be used anywhere else.  So a ${daexim.version} is just overhead.  We could also do dependencyManagement with daexim-artifacts, but again, I would typically only switch to that if I needed to copy/paste the version more than once.  If you feel strongly about this, then please express that with a -1 instead of a +1. I took this comment as \"just an idea\", but ignored it because you +1\u0027d it anyway.",
