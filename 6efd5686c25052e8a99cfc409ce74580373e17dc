      "message": "Yeah hang on guys - I agree with Faseela, this one here (line 175) should be a LOG.error, because if we hit this far then we\u0027ve really failed for some deeper reason, while retrying, which is more than just a WARN. The important thing here is that we missed the ,e earlier - so we didn\u0027t know why we failed.\n\nOr are we misunderstanding this.. is this hit in case of an OptimisticLockFailedException / ConflictingModificationAppliedException ? But then this entire logic is flawed - in that case, we do want to keep retrying?  So then should we not handle that inside readWriteLock, and return false?\n\nHow about we just start over with real TDD here? ;-)",
