      "message": "Yeah hang on guys - I agree with Faseela, this one here (line 175) should be a LOG.error, because if we hit this far then we\u0027ve really failed for some deeper reason, while retrying, which is more than just a WARN. The important thing here is that we missed the ,e earlier - so we didn\u0027t know why we failed.\n\nOr are we misunderstanding this.. is this hit in case of an OptimisticLockFailedException / ConflictingModificationAppliedException ? But then this entire logic is flawed - in that case, we do want to keep retrying?  So then should we not handle that inside readWriteLock, and return false?\n\nHow about we just start over with real TDD here? ;-)",

      "message": "The reason why this was changed to WARN was based on what was mentioned in Bug 8059.\nLockManager tries to write to DS and if there are some exceptions while trying to write to DS(or if already locked) it keeps on retrying. So there are chances that the logs might get filled up with exceptions when there are multiple requests for the same lock.\n\nLet me know your opinion on this.",
