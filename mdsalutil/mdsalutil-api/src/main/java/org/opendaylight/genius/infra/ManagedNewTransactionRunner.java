 * Managed transactions utility to simplify handling of new transactions and ensure they are always closed
 * (see {@link ManagedNewTransactionRunnerImpl}). One of the implementations of this API can, optionally, do
 * retries (see {@link RetryingManagedNewTransactionRunnerImpl}).  When you want both together (which is typical),
 * it is recommended to use the {@link RetryingManagedNewTransactionRunner}.
 *
 * <p>This should typically be used (only) directly in code which really must be creating its own new transactions,
 * such as RPC entry points, or background jobs.  Other lower level code "behind" such entry points should
 * just get handed over the transaction provided by this API.
