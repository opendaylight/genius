/**
 * Cache wannabe.
 *
 * <p>This class wanted to be Cache when it was grown up. Currently it's actually just
 * a nested ConcurrentMap, and thus has fairly limited real value.
 *
 * <p>The usage of static methods here, instead of an (OSGi) "service"
 * (dependency inject-able in tests!) makes it impossible to easily properly
 * use code relying on this in component tests (as there would be no automatic
 * reset between tests; you would have to manually {@link #destroyCache(String)}
 * {@literal @}Before each test).
 *
 * <p>This class' "static" Singleton doesn't play nice with OSGi e.g. for hot reload.
 *
 * <p>This class' (necessary) use &lt;?&gt; generics causes {@literal @}SuppressWarnings("unchecked") when used.
 *
 * <p>Perhaps you would like to use <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained">
 * Google Guava's simple Caches</a>, if not a full blown JSR 107 javax.cache (JCache) implementation,
 * such as <a href="http://infinispan.org">Infinispan</a> or <a href="http://www.ehcache.org">Ehcache</a>,
 * instead of this class?
 *
 * @deprecated We now recommend you simply use your own <tt>new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;&gt;()</tt> instead.
