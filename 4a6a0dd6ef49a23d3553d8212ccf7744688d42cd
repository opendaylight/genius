      "message": "Strictly speaking this is not a mechanical change anymore, because before we returned just RpcResultBuilder.success() whereas now it\u0027s success(new TryLockOutputBuilder().build()) - which seems more correct, I would have to agree.  If a client relied on null this would be a breaking change, but I think that\u0027s unlikely, so I\u0027m OK with this - just thought it would be worth pointing it out.",
