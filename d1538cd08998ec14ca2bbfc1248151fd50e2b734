      "message": "Stephen, if this NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF supression is broken, then why do we use @SuppressFBWarnings in code (here and it presumably be required elsewhere?) instead of adding it to the exclusion in odlparent:findbugs (or infrautils:findbugs) ? Or is this actully indicative of a likely bug in this code which we actually should fix?",

      "message": "FTR: Given that the rest of ODL right now is still on odlparent 3.1.0, the use of a 3.1.1 here means that with this it is no longer possible to build ODL from sources without using nexus.opendaylight.org without locally building and installing two different branches of odlparent.  I find this weird, but if skitt can confirm that this is not a problem for a red downstream build (I\u0027m assuming he will, otherwise he would not have done this), and Faseela can ask around and confirm this is not a problem for the downstream in-house build at Ericsson either, then I\u0027m OK with using a more recent version of an odlparent artifact here than elsewhere for genius.  Otherwise, I think it would be better to use the infrautils:findbugs artifact, which can be built in a simpler all-from-master single branch downstream build.\n\nPS: I\u0027ve verified that odlparent:findbugs v3.1.0+ has the SLF4J_LOGGER_SHOULD_BE_NON_STATIC exclusion which I had added in infrautils:findbugs when it was not yet available from odlparent, so this causes no regression re. that.",
