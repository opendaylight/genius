      "message": "-1 just to \"force\" a discussion (David, perhaps post to genius-dev list?) re. whether we even actually want to use a JobCoordinator here... I\u0027m not sure I get the real need.  Isn\u0027t JobCoordinator really for stuff with those keys and all that - we don\u0027t use that here, so this adds complexity, without the need... what if, instead of JobCoordinator, we just passed an Executor[Service?] (or ForkJoinPool?) here?  We could even imagine \u0026 discuss registering a suitable one in the OSGi registry, perhaps from infrautils, which could be @OsgiService injected here?",
