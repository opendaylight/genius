      "message": "not sure I understand this logic - is this some convention in ActionType? To add more than one actionValues to indicate this is a groupBucket? Even though actionValues[1+] are never looked at?\n\nI see some other functions here have similar logic but with an optional boolean groupBucket - why not do the same? Seems the creation of the tunnel src ip action and the association of it into an apply_actions/bucket should be separated, but i\u0027m not that familiar with this area.",

      "message": "My understanding is that this option is used when action is to be added to a bucket in group instead of apply actions. Other usage came in as part of ARP Responder changes which were borrowed from similar utils in legacy netvirt. No one is using this option yet but I intend to try it out and revisit this later.\n\nNow that generic methods for regLoad and regMove have been added, think it makes sense to use them. Was planning to do it in a separate refactoring patch, but would use them for this new code itself and do rest of refactoring later.",
