      "message": "not sure I understand this logic - is this some convention in ActionType? To add more than one actionValues to indicate this is a groupBucket? Even though actionValues[1+] are never looked at?\n\nI see some other functions here have similar logic but with an optional boolean groupBucket - why not do the same? Seems the creation of the tunnel src ip action and the association of it into an apply_actions/bucket should be separated, but i\u0027m not that familiar with this area.",
